--------------------------------
Unix V7 libdbm, in more modern C
--------------------------------

What it is
----------

This is libdbm derived from version 7 UNIX (see COPYING regarding the
license), modernized to contemporary Gnu C and using Auto-tools, and
eventually even improved.

This code is **AS-IS**.

Rationale
---------

My doctor said I need a hobby.


TODO list
---------

* dbm_close() does not flush.
* Make the page size be variable. Perhaps add a third file describing
  the database parameters instead of using the ``PBLKSIZ`` const *et al.*
